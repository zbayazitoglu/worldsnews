            <h2>US President Donald Trump has made a last bid for voters to back the Republican party on the eve of a nationwide election that is seen as a referendum on his presidency.</h2>

            
            <p>"Everything we have achieved is at stake tomorrow," he said during a blitz of three final rallies. <br>
                <br>
        
                The mid-term elections come half way through his four years in office, and will determine how effectively he can govern for the next two years.
                <br>
                <br>
                Voter turnout is expected to be high.
                <br>
                <br>
                At stake are 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 35 of 100 seats in the Senate - the two bodies that make up Congress. Governors are also being chosen in 36 out of 50 states.</p>

            <p>In recent days, the president has ratcheted up rhetoric on divisive issues in a bid to energise his base.
                    <br>
                    <br>    Barack Obama - on the campaign trail for the Democratic party - said "the character of our country is on the ballot". <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1059517317011398656" target="blank">The former president tweeted the vote "might be the most important of our lifetimes".</a></p>
